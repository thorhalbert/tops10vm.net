A format decoder is essentially made of states or modes.

Some modes are peers, and some are dependant or nested inside another mode.

So, when given modes are extant, a given format obtains, when not, another.

Things would then arrange themselves as boolean if statements or case statements.   Instead of 
specifying program flow, they specify the interior content.   Some content may exist or not
depending on the states that wrap them.



















Now, we might need a parser to do this one...


title name;
namespace name;

struct name {
	address:	

}
