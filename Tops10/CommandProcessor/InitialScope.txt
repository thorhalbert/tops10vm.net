Eventually this might become a full on emulation of the TOPS-10 shell,
but, initially I just need a few commands to be able to:

1.  Set up the CPU (probably not normal TOPS-10 commands)
2.  Load the Diagnostic -- eventually need to load .EXE and perhaps .A10 files
3.  Patch them (normal E and D commands) -- some of them need to be made to exit
4.  Start them

And we record the output.
Most of them have a start line, and then will exit.  We will provide exit and error
(usually a halt instruction) output.  This gets diffed a standard file to determine sucess.


SET CPU /TYPE KA10   (KI10,KL10,KS10,  whatever KC10, KD10, KX10, KN10 for emulators)
SET CPU /FLAGS set initial flags - put in exec mode, UIO mode, etc

CORE x  (set core) 

GET "unix_path" 

need generic way to escape local filename

E x
D x y
D/ASCII "ABCDE"
D/SIXBIT "ABCDEF"
D/RAD50 "ABCDEF"
D/INSTR "INSTR AC,@ADDR(XT)"

START
START x

BREAK x
BREAK x ON VALUE:x:is:y

	break 10004 on value:20002:gt:5
	
	x can be followed by l or r to designate halfwords
