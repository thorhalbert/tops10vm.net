TOPS-10 Emulator in .NET

This was my second attempt at writing a tops-10 (and possibily tops-20) emulator, but in C# instead of C.

The root of this was a port of the SIMH pdp-10 processor engine.  I make no claims on this excellent original code.  And give full credit to Bob Supnik and others involved with the project.
The SIMH version I branched from was rather old, but so then is the 10 code.

There's a graphical UI which shows the processor run, and there's an amusing set of modern unit tests that run 45 year old paper-tape images.
